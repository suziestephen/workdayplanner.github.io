<b> My Process</b>
I created the standard HTML file that would include the links to the necessary libraries for date, time and script as well as the standard text to display.
To complete this task I had to find access to the moment.js library that would allow me to accurate record dates and times.
Then I had to build out the structure of the planner using both Bootstrap formatting for the layout and accurate recording of variables for the timeslots 9am - 5pm (a standard working day).
I also had to incorporate some of the more intricate processes of the planner including being able to save data and have this data be stored - even when the browser is refreshed - unless the user uses the Clear All button, another function that had to be coded into the script. 
 

<b>Our Brief</b>
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


<b>REQUIREMENTS</b>
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
